# UX Portfolio

Hello, my name is Reynaldo but I go by Rey. I'm from Bakersfield CA, and came to Chico State because it has a great engineering program. I am a junior at Chico State and currently working towards obtaining my Mechanical Engineering degree, and considering a minor in either Electrical Engineering or Advanced Manufacturing. Some of my hobbies consist of fishing, traveling, gaming, and hanging out with friends.
