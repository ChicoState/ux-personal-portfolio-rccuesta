Lost Builds Remastered

I chose to investigate LEGOÂ® Builder, 

Growing up one of my biggest hobbies was collecting Legos, I would build them, display them, and then toss out their boxes and instructions. Most of the time the instructions would get destroyed or lost but my sets were mainly used as decorations so I was never worried about having to rebuild them; however, one day after school I came home and my sets were all over the floor and destroyed. Without the instructions, there was no way for me to rebuild them, so into a bucket they went. 

Before discovering this app there were only a few ways to obtain set instructions, mainly 3rd party sites and resellers which meant depending on the popularity of the set or instructions it could be a lot more costly.

Lego Builder utilizes an application of **"Recognition Rather than Recall"**, a useability guideline that uses visual cues rather than relying on the builder to remember the previous steps. A reason a builder might want to use an application like this than using the instruction manual is that it uses visuals that help the user see how they need to build and where it goes

Over the years sets have been recreated over and over again so trying to find the set that matches yours can sometimes be rather tricky
