# Lost Builds Remastered

I chose to investigate LEGOÂ® Builder, an app that contains hundreds of instruction manuals from a multitude of themes. As a result of these online PDFs builders no longer have to rely on their physical manuals. lost or destroyed it doesn't matter, instructions can now be accessed **efficiently** with a couple of clicks, it also allows builders to see the parts they need so they can order the parts and recreate the sets they were unable to buy during a specific time, new or retired.

Growing up one of my biggest hobbies was collecting Legos, I would build them, display them, and then toss out their boxes and instructions. Most of the time the instructions would get destroyed or lost but my sets were mainly used as decorations, I was never worried about having to rebuild them; however, one day after school I came home and my sets were all over the floor and destroyed. Without the instructions, there was no way for me to rebuild them, so into a bucket they went. 

Before the creation of these apps, there were only a few ways to obtain set instructions, mainly 3rd party sites and resellers which meant depending on the popularity of the set or instructions it could be a lot more costly.

Lego Builder utilizes an application of **"Recognition Rather than Recall"**, a usability guideline that uses visual cues rather than relying on the builder to remember the previous steps and block placement. A reason a builder might want to use an application like this rather than the physical manual is that it utilizes more effective visuals than the physical manual; it allows the user to see where the blocks need to be placed by highlighting the spots, as well as allowing the user to rotate the model so they can see the other features.

Sets have been recreated multiple times over the years so trying to find the exact set that matches yours can be challenging, so grouping themes and separating the sets by the release date can create an easier experience for the user.
