# Lost Builds Remastered

Reynaldo Cuesta ( March 18, 2024)

I chose to investigate LEGOÂ® Builder, an app that contains hundreds of instruction manuals from a multitude of themes, new and retired. As a result of these online PDFs builders no longer have to rely on their physical manuals. lost or destroyed it doesn't matter, instructions can now be accessed **efficiently** with a couple of clicks. As sets retire prices go up due to them becoming collectible items; having access to the instructions allows fans to obtain these sets through other means. Fans can recreate past sets by buying each part individually and rebuilding the set that way; while they might not have the original they have a desired set and a fraction of the price.

Growing up one of my biggest hobbies was collecting Legos; My sets were mainly used as decorations and most of the time the instructions would get forgotten and destroyed or lost. I was never worried about having to rebuild them because they were decoration pieces, however, I came home one day to find many of my sets destroyed on the floor. Without the instructions, there was no way for me to rebuild my sets. 

Instruction manuals, like books you read from left to right, so when using the online manuals I would assume that it would be the same; I'm using my **mental model** (How I think it should work) as a basis to imagine how the software would work. The  **conceptual model** (How it actually works) for this scenario would match. Making the online manuals as close to the physical manuals allows all users to transfer their preexisting knowledge to a different platform which falls into one of our heuristic evaluations **"Consistency and Standards"**.

Lego Builder utilizes an application of **"Recognition Rather than Recall"**, a usability guideline that uses visual cues rather than relying on the builder to remember the previous steps and block placement. A reason a builder might want to use an application like this rather than the physical manual is that it utilizes more effective visuals than the physical manual. It allows the user to see where the blocks need to be placed by highlighting the spots, as well as allowing the user to rotate the model so they can see the other features.

Sets have been recreated multiple times over the years so trying to find the exact set that matches yours can be challenging. Prefiltering instructions by grouping themes and separating the sets by the release date can create an easier experience for the user as well as create a more **aesthetic** workspace. Finding the theme you are looking for is probably the easiest part to do, if you are looking for a retired set the profile picture might not match the original, so a little more digging might be necessary. After finding the theme however knowing the year it was produced should be the next course of action so that the options are more limited, it can become a headache looking specifically for a set when there are multiple that look the same

For the most part online instruction manuals come in handy, especially if you no longer have the manuals, but other times the app can be flawed. A big issue can be the rendering of images on the older sets, it takes a lot of zooming in to see where the parts go. The 3-D modeling on the older sets either doesn't work or sometimes causes it to freeze up. Every update they slowly incorporate 3-D modeling to other sets that don't already have it, so if you're working on a set with modeling the next one you work on might not have it. They are pretty good about having the majority of the instruction sets but there are still a few that don't seem to appear on the site as of yet.
